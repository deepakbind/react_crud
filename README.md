################

Task 1: Dashboard Implementation



Implement the dashboard layout based on the design.
Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.
Card Population:
The dashboard contains multiple cards.
Populate each card with random images obtained from the provided API (details below).
Display at least 6 cards on the dashboard.


####################
Task 2: API Integration
API for Random Images:
Use the Lorem Picsum API to fetch random images for populating the cards.
API Endpoint: https://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=1&limit=6
The API returns a JSON array of image details, including URLs.
Handle errors gracefully.


######################
Task 3: CRUD Operations
Create Operation:
Implement the ability to add new cards to the dashboard.
Include a form or modal for users to input necessary information.
Validate and add the new card to the dashboard.
Read Operation:
Enable users to view details of each card by clicking on it.
Display additional information on a separate modal or panel.
Update Operation:
Allow users to edit the content of existing cards.
Implement a form or inline editing for easy modification.
Delete Operation:
Provide the functionality to delete a card from the dashboard.
Implement a confirmation dialogue before deletion.


################################333
Task 4: Deployment
Deploy the Frontend:
Deploy the frontend of your dashboard to a cloud platform of your choice (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, or any other).
Ensure that the deployed version is accessible via a public URL.
Optional Backend Deployment (if implemented):
If you have implemented a backend (with or without a database), you can choose to deploy it as well.
Provide clear instructions on how to deploy and interact with the backend, if applicable.
If not deploying the backend, ensure that the frontend functions seamlessly with the mock data or API.

Submission Guidelines:
Create a github repository.
Create a branch named submission.
Commit your changes to the submission branch.
Push the branch to your repository.
Share the link to your forked repository with us.
Evaluation Criteria:
Design Accuracy: How closely does your implementation match the provided Figma design?
Functionality: Does the dashboard display random images? Can users perform CRUD operations seamlessly?
Code Quality: Clean and well-documented code.
Responsive Design: How well does the dashboard adapt to different screen sizes?
Important Notes:
You are encouraged to use any JavaScript framework/library of your choice.
Clearly mention any assumptions made during the implementation.
If you encounter issues or challenges, document them in your code or README file.

Best of luck! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
